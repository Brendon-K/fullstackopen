| Task Description | Start | End | Note | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start part 2 | 6:50 PM | 6:55 PM | false start, forgot something | 5 M |
| Resume | 8:28 PM | 9:26 PM | Finished 2.1 | 28 M |
| 2.2 Finished |  | 9:56 PM | oh my god I got hung up for so long on the stupidest error oh my god | 30 M |
| 2.3 Finished |  | 9:56 PM | uhhhh I accidentally did this already in 2.2 | 0 M |
| 2.4 Finished |  | 10:04 PM |  | 8 M |
| 2.5 Finished |  | 10:04 PM | I thought this was the expectation starting in 2.1 tbh | 0 M |
| 2b Start | 11:40 AM | 12:18 PM | 2.6 Finished | 38 M |
| 2.7 Finished |  | 12:30 PM |  | 12 M |
| 2.8 Finished |  | 12:42 PM |  | 12 M |
| 2.9 Finished |  | 12:57 PM |  | 15 M |
| 2.9 "Finished" |  | 2:07 PM | nvm I actually wasn't done with 2.9<br>~~I spent ages trying to figure out how to make the name addition follow the active filter but I just gave up, so it doesn't do that.<br>Changing the filter will reflect properly, but if you add a name that matches the current filter, it doesn't show up immediately.<br>Hoping that I'm just getting ahead of myself and future lessons cover how to handle this kind of thing.~~<br>~~So... 2.9 "done" I guess~~ | 1 H 10 M |
| 2.9 Finished Actually Though |  | 2:17 PM | I was being real stupid I guess, the solution was obvious, I did it properly now. | 10 M |
| 2.10 Finished |  | 2:33 PM | Once again went on a wild goose chase. I had forgotten I ALREADY extracted Persons as a component, so I was trying to do some stupid nonsense that made no sense for way too long. I think it's a good time for a break. | 16 M |
| 2c Start | 3:29 PM | 4:12 PM | 2.11 Finished | 43 M |
| 2d Start | 7:30 PM | 8:59 PM | idk what I'm doing. the asynchronicity of using the server is making it so I still have an empty list of people when the page tries to load the names. stopping for now | 1 H 29 M |
| 2.12 Finished | 7:14 AM | 7:26 AM | I was being dumb AGAIN. It wasn't an issue with syncing at all. It was because I wasn't updating the state correctly. | 12 M |
| 2.13 Finished |  | 7:37 AM |  | 9 M |
| 2.14 Finished |  | 7:55 AM |  | 18 M |
| 2.14 Finished For Realsies |  | 8:10 AM | I lied. Forgot to use window.confirm. | 15 M |
| I think I just realized that my filter STILL DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY. |  | 8:28 AM | Adding a person with an active filter sets their default visibility to false if they don't match the current filter, making it so they won't appear by default when the page reloads (they still appear if they match the filter). Seems like it should be an easy fix, but I have to leave now so just leaving this note for myself when I return.<br>(note to self: get rid of matching variable entirely, and just array.filter people instead) | 18 M |
| Resuming | 6:21 PM | 6:26 PM | Fixed filter problem, and it's soooooo much nicer now actually. I did way too much before. | 5 M |
| 2.15 Finished |  | 6:49 PM |  | 23 M |
| 2.16 Finished |  | 7:18 PM |  | 29 M |
| 2.17 Finished |  | 7:30 PM |  | 12 M |
| 2e continued | 9:11 PM | 10:07 PM | I keep getting distracted and I'm not really making any progress. Break time. | 56 M |
| 2.18 resume | 11:42 AM | 12:06 PM | Officially finished 2.18, but I kinda DO want to worry about those edge cases, so I'm gonna do that now. | 24 M |
| Finished outlier |  | 12:11 PM | Okay that was actually really easy. Basically 1 extra line. | 5 M |
| 2.19 in progress |  | 12:26 PM | I have 0 focus right now. Taking a break. | 15 M |
| 2.19 in progress | 5:22 PM | 5:42 PM | I think I just need to restart this whole part tbh. Completely stuck. | 20 M |
| Restarted country thing from scratch | idk | idk | I did end up restarting it, and it was way easier | idk like an hour and a half I guess |
| Finished 2.20 | idk | idk | Finished across two lunch breaks | Probably around an hour |
