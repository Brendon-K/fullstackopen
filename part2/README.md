start: 6:50p, oops at 6:55p	--	5m

resume: 8:28p, 2.1 finished 9:26p --  58m

2.2 finished 9:56p oh my god I got hung up for so long on the stupidest error oh my god -- 30m

2.3 uhhhh I accidentally did this already in 2.2 -- 0m

2.4 finished 10:04p -- 8m

2.5 I thought this was the expectation starting in 2.1 tbh -- 0m

start: 11:40a, 2.6 done @ 12:18p -- 38m

2.7 done @ 12:30p -- 12m

2.8 done @ 12:42p -- 12m

2.9 done @ 12:57p -- 15m

nvm I actually wasn't done with 2.9

~~I spent ages trying to figure out how to make the name addition follow the active filter
but I just gave up, so it doesn't do that. Changing the filter will reflect properly, but if you add a name that matches the current filter, it doesn't show up immdiately
hoping that I'm just getting ahead of myself and future lessons cover how to handle this kind of thing~~

~~so... 2.9 "done" I guess~~ @ 2:07p -- 1h 10m

I was being real stupid I guess, the solution was obvious, I did it properly now. @ 2:17p -- 10m

Once again went on a wild goose chase. I had forgotten I ALREADY extracted Persons as a component, so I was trying to do some stupid nonsense that made no sense for way too long. I think it's a good time for a break. Finished 2.10 @ 2:33p -- 16m

2c start @ 3:29p, 2.11 finished @ 4:12p -- 43m

2d start @ 7:30pm

idk what I'm doing. the asynchronicity of using the server is making it so I still have an empty list of people when the page tries to load the names. stopping for now @ 8:59p -- 1h 29m

I actually don't think it's a synchronous issue, but I still don't know what's going on... starting @ 7:14am

Okay it was actually because I wasn't updating the state with the correct info. Finished 2.12 @ 7:26a -- 12m

Finished 2.13 @ 7:37a -- 9m

Finished 2.14 @ 7:55a -- 18m

I lied. Forgot to use window.confirm. Finished for realsies @ 8:10a -- 15m
