start: 6:50p, oops at 6:55p	--	5m

resume: 8:28p, 2.1 finished 9:26p --  58m

2.2 finished 9:56p oh my god I got hung up for so long on the stupidest error oh my god -- 30m

2.3 uhhhh I accidentally did this already in 2.2 -- 0m

2.4 finished 10:04p -- 8m

2.5 I thought this was the expectation starting in 2.1 tbh -- 0m

start: 11:40a, 2.6 done @ 12:18p -- 38m

2.7 done @ 12:30p -- 12m

2.8 done @ 12:42p -- 12m

2.9 done @ 12:57p -- 15m

nvm I actually wasn't done with 2.9

~~I spent ages trying to figure out how to make the name addition follow the active filter
but I just gave up, so it doesn't do that. Changing the filter will reflect properly, but if you add a name that matches the current filter, it doesn't show up immdiately
hoping that I'm just getting ahead of myself and future lessons cover how to handle this kind of thing~~

~~so... 2.9 "done" I guess~~ @ 2:07p -- 1h 10m

I was being real stupid I guess, the solution was obvious, I did it properly now. @ 2:17p -- 10m

Once again went on a wild goose chase. I had forgotten I ALREADY extracted Persons as a component, so I was trying to do some stupid nonsense that made no sense for way too long. I think it's a good time for a break. Finished 2.10 @ 2:33p -- 16m

2c start @ 3:29p, 2.11 finished @ 4:12p -- 43m

2d start @ 7:30pm

idk what I'm doing. the asynchronicity of using the server is making it so I still have an empty list of people when the page tries to load the names. stopping for now @ 8:59p -- 1h 29m

I actually don't think it's a synchronous issue, but I still don't know what's going on... starting @ 7:14am

Okay it was actually because I wasn't updating the state with the correct info. Finished 2.12 @ 7:26a -- 12m

Finished 2.13 @ 7:37a -- 9m

Finished 2.14 @ 7:55a -- 18m

I lied. Forgot to use window.confirm. Finished for realsies @ 8:10a -- 15m

I think I just realized that my filter STILL DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY. 

Adding a person with an active filter sets their default visibility to false if they don't match the current filter, making it so they won't appear by default when the page reloads (they still appear if they match the filter). Seems like it should be an easy fix, but I have to leave now so just leaving this note for myself when I return. @ 8:28a -- 18m

(note to self: get rid of matching variable entirely, and just array.filter people instead)

resume @ 6:21p

fixed filter problem, and it's soooooo much nicer now actually. I did way too much before. @ 6:26p --5m

2.15 finished @ 6:49p -- 23m
